# GPREC QUIZ APPLICATION

**Problem Statement**<br>
The project tackles the widespread challenges in our college's assessment system, including problems like cheating through copy-paste and tab switching during online quizzes, along with the complex manual process of calculating scores for multiple quizzes. 

**Solution**<br>
The solution we're aiming for involves creating a customized online quiz app that has strong security to prevent cheating, a time limit feature to make sure everyone gets a fair shot, and an automatic score calculation that adds up the best three scores from five quizzes. This way, we can improve how we test students.

- While attempting quiz, students cannot switch tabs.
- Students cannot copy the contents of the quiz.
- Time limits for each quiz.
- Automatic quiz score calculation that adds up the best three scores from five quizzes.
- Section wise Notice boards.
